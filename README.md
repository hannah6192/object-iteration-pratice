## For... in Loops

Problem 1:
Log the property names and values using for... in loop. 

Expected Result:
```js
name: 'John'
age: 30
city: 'New York'
```

Problem 2: 
Sum all of the values in each property and `console.log` sum to test if it works.

Expected Result:
```js
console.log(sum); // Output: 60
```

Problem 3:
Create a new object with a modified property value. Each value should be multiplied by 2 in the new object.

Expected Result:
```js
{a: 2, b: 4, c: 6}
```

## For... of Loops
In the `for-of-loops.js` file, you are going to create yourself in an object that will look similar to mine. 

You will need a `name`, `age`, `hobbies` (in an array) and a boolean of `isEngineer` which is set to true. 

Task 1:
Using the method `Object.values`, print each value of your object.

Task 2: 
Using the method `Object.keys`, print out and label each key and value on separate lines.
E.g
```js
console.log('key:', [insert var name] );
console.log('value:', [insert var name] )
```

Task 3:
Using `Object.entries` (which uses array destructing), print out each key and value on the same line.


### Bonus
Modify one of the for... in loops and print out each hobbie inside of the array.
